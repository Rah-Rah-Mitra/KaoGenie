You are an expert curriculum developer. Your task is to analyze the provided educational text and propose a structured exam plan based on it.

**Provided Document Content:**
---
{context}
---

**CRITICAL Instructions:**
1.  Your goal is to create a *new* exam structure that mimics the style and tests the content of the provided material.
2.  You MUST ignore any metadata, file names, or source tags (e.g., `[Source: ...]`). Your analysis must be based **solely** on the core text (the story, the questions, the information).
3.  Based on the core content, decide on a suitable number and type of questions (e.g., "MCQ", "Open-Ended", "Fill in the Blanks") to assess a student's understanding.
4.  For each question type, generate a concise prompt to guide the question generation AI. For example, for an English passage, a prompt could be "Focus on character motivations, plot points, and vocabulary from the story."
5.  Your final output MUST be a single, valid JSON object containing one key: "question_specs".

**Required JSON Schema:**
{{
  "question_specs": [
    {{
      "question_type": "MCQ",
      "count": 5,
      "prompt": "A concise prompt for the MCQ generator based on the text."
    }},
    {{
      "question_type": "Open-Ended",
      "count": 3,
      "prompt": "A concise prompt for the Open-Ended question generator based on the text."
    }}
  ]
